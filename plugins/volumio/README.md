# Volumio

Plugin name: volumio

## Description

This plugin communicates with the Open Source Music player Linux distribution, [Volumio](https://volumio.org/). Any computer with Volumio booted and with a suitable soundcard and a set of nice speakers could be used, and all controlled using the Mediaplayer and Mediaplayer-favorite modules of this Dashboard using this plugin. For the Mediaplayer-favorite module to work properly the Spotify-plugin of Volumio needs to be loaded, since this plugin was made with [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/se/) as favoritelist source (that could be fixed in the future).

## Tested hardware

This is a generic plugin that should work with all sorts of soundcards, but it has been tested with a [HiFiBerry AMP2](https://www.hifiberry.com/) with great success.
